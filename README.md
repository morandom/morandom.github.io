You can make some small modifications to the site by changing the files here,
find a template you think is really cool and use that, or start completly from scratch!

A blank canvas version of this template exists on the branch `config/raw`

**Disclaimer**  
I'm not sure how easy these following templates are to change

A nice minimalistic blogging template is on the branch `config/hyde`

A more complex and pretty cool theme can be found on the branch `config/spectral`
